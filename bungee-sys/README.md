# bungee-sys: Rust FFI Bindings for Bungee Audio Time-Stretching Library

`bungee-sys` provides low-level, unsafe Rust bindings for the [Bungee](https://github.com/bungee-audio-stretch/bungee) C++ audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting library.

Prefer using the high-level and *safer* `bungee-rs` crate instead.

## License

`bungee-sys` is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license, consistent with the upstream Bungee library.
